## 1.Find Pivot Index

Given an array of integers nums, calculate the pivot index of this array.

The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.

If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.

Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.



### Example:

Input: nums = [1,7,3,6,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The pivot index is 3.
Left sum = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + 7 + 3 = 11
Right sum = nums[4] + nums[5] = 5 + 6 = 11
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
There is no index that satisfies the conditions in the problem statement.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,1,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation:
The pivot index is 0.
Left sum = 0 (no elements to the left of index 0)
Right sum = nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + -1 = 0

## 2.Find sum of array

Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
Return the running sum of nums.



### Example:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
Output: [3,4,6,16,17]
9

## 3.Plus minus problem

Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with  places after the decimal.


### Example
arr = [1,1,0,-1,0,-1]
There are  5 elements, two positive, two negative and one zero. Their ratios are ,  and . Results are printed as:

0.400000
0.400000
0.200000
Function Description

Complete the plusMinus function in the editor below.

plusMinus has the following parameter(s):

int arr[n]: an array of integers
Print
Print the ratios of positive, negative and zero values in the array. Each value should be printed on a separate line with  digits after the decimal. The function should not return a value.

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , the size of the array.
The second line contains  space-separated integers that describe .

### Output Format

Print the following  lines, each to  decimals:

proportion of positive values
proportion of negative values
proportion of zeros
Sample Input

## 4.Diagonal difference matrix

Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix  is shown below:

1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  
The left-to-right diagonal = 1+5+9=15 . The right to left diagonal =3+5+9 . Their absolute difference is |15-17|=2 .


### Output Format

Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.

### Sample Input

3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12
Sample Output

15
### Explanation

The primary diagonal is:

11
5
-12
Sum across the primary diagonal: 11 + 5 - 12 = 4

The secondary diagonal is:

4
5
10
Sum across the secondary diagonal: 4 + 5 + 10 = 19
Difference: |4 - 19| = 15
